      `**Summary**\n\n` +
      `**Root cause analysis** Based on the ClusterVersion data:\n` +
      `• **Current version:** ${CLUSTER_CURRENT_VERSION}\n` +
      `• **Target version:** ${CLUSTER_CURRENT_VERSION}\n` +
      `• **Failure type:** No active ClusterVersion failure. Condition type='Failing' has status='False', so the cluster version is **not failing**.\n\n` +
      `**Specific error:** No Failing=True message exists on ClusterVersion. The actual upgrade gate is separate: condition type='Upgradeable' has status='False' with message: '**${CLUSTER_BLOCKER_MESSAGE}**'.\n\n` +
      `**Component analysis**\n` +
      `• **Failed ClusterOperators:** 1 problematic operator: **machine-config**\n` +
      `  • Condition type='Available' has status='True' → available\n` +
      `  • Condition type='Degraded' has status='True' → degraded\n` +
      `  • Condition type='Progressing' has status='False' → not actively progressing\n` +
      `• **Operator error details:** machine-config controller logs show repeated errors:\n` +
      `  • "could not find the requested rhel-10 default stream in the list of OSImageStreams [rhel-9]"\n` +
      `  • "reading manifest ... in image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/openshift-lightspeed/cvo-patched: authentication required"\n` +
      `  • User-friendly: the machine-config controller is trying to build OS image stream metadata, but the payload lookup is failing due to **registry authentication** and **missing expected RHEL 10 stream metadata**.\n` +
      `• **Stuck ClusterOperators:** None observed. No ClusterOperator was returned with Progressing=True and an error message.\n` +
      `• **Affected services:** Upgrade readiness is impacted. Cluster service health is otherwise mostly intact because ClusterVersion is Available=True and machine-config remains Available=True.\n\n` +
      `**Failed upgrade context**\n` +
      `• **Target version:** ${CLUSTER_CURRENT_VERSION}\n` +
      `• **Release information:** No desired release URL was present in ClusterVersion status.desired. Available update metadata exists for **${CLUSTER_PATCH_VERSION}** and **5.1.0**.\n` +
      `• **Upgrade path:** ${CLUSTER_CURRENT_VERSION} → ${CLUSTER_CURRENT_VERSION} (no version change)\n` +
      `• **Target availability:** The current target is already installed. In \`availableUpdates\`, only **${CLUSTER_PATCH_VERSION}** and **5.1.0** were listed.\n\n` +
      `**Historical failure analysis**\n` +
      `• **Previous attempts:** ClusterVersion history shows **3 completed entries**, all for **${CLUSTER_CURRENT_VERSION}**\n` +
      `• **Failure pattern:** No failed upgrade attempts are recorded in ClusterVersion history\n` +
      `• **Last successful upgrade:** ${CLUSTER_CURRENT_VERSION} completed at **2026-08-18T23:12:36Z**\n` +
      `• **Cluster stability:** Upgrade history does **not** show a failed rollout; the current issue is a **post-upgrade degraded operator / future upgrade blocker**, not a failed version transition\n\n` +
      `**Update service health**\n` +
      `• **Service configuration:** Custom upstream graph is configured\n` +
      `• **Cincinnati status:** condition type \`RetrievedUpdates\` has status \`True\`\n` +
      `• **Last update check:** **2026-08-18T22:55:44Z**\n` +
      `• **Available updates:** **${CLUSTER_PATCH_VERSION}** and **5.1.0**\n` +
      `• **Connectivity issues:** No Cincinnati problems. The **machine-config controller’s payload/OS image stream access** is the source of connectivity/auth issues.\n\n` +
      `**Failure events timeline (Last hour)**\n` +
      `• **Event summary:** No clear Warning/Error sequence was found for the upgrade failure.\n` +
      `• **Timeline of key events:**\n` +
      `  • machine-config events show repeated **FeatureGatesInitialized**\n` +
      `  • nodes were marked **NodeDone**\n` +
      `  • updates completed and nodes were **Uncordon**ed\n` +
      `• In alerts/logs, the relevant signals are: **ClusterOperatorDegraded(machine-config)** and **TargetDown(machine-config-controller)**\n\n` +
      `**Investigation steps**\n` +
      `1. Verify missing parent credentials (\`${CLUSTER_BLOCKER_SECRET}\`).\n` +
      `2. Inspect machine-config controller logs for **authentication required** and missing rhel-10 stream errors.\n` +
      `3. Collect cluster diagnostics using \`oc adm must-gather\`.\n\n` +
      `**Recovery actions (Conservative Approach)**\n` +
      `• Treat the issue as an **upgrade gate + degraded machine-config reconciliation**, not a failed upgrade.\n` +
      `• After restoring credentials, monitor \`Upgradeable\` and \`Degraded\`.\n` +
      `• Escalate to support if the issue persists.\n\n` +
      `**TL;DR**\n` +
      `• **Failure type:** No active ClusterVersion failure; actual blocker is **Upgradeable=False** with '**${CLUSTER_BLOCKER_MESSAGE}**'\n` +
      `• **Data completeness:** **Partial** — ClusterVersion, ClusterOperators, MCPs, alerts, and one critical operator log were retrieved; events were too broad to fully reconstruct a precise warning timeline, and full node output was truncated\n` +
      `• **Target version:** ${CLUSTER_CURRENT_VERSION}; available updates listed are **${CLUSTER_PATCH_VERSION}** and **5.1.0**\n` +
      `• **Root cause:** **Moderate confidence:** this is **not a failed upgrade rollout**. The main issues are **upgrade blocked by missing AWS parent credentials secret** and **machine-config operator degraded** with log evidence of **payload registry authentication failure** and **missing rhel-10 OS image stream metadata**\n` +
      `• **Failed components:** 1 failed/degraded ClusterOperator: **machine-config**\n` +
      `• **Error messages:**\n` +
      `  • **${CLUSTER_BLOCKER_MESSAGE}**\n` +
      `  • **could not find the requested rhel-10 default stream in the list of OSImageStreams [rhel-9]**\n` +
      `  • **authentication required** when reading the payload manifest from the internal registry\n` +
      `• **Event summary:** No strong machine-config failure event chain was found in the sampled event results; visible machine-config events were mostly normal completion events.\n` +
      `• **Alert status:** Relevant active alerts: **ClusterOperatorDegraded(machine-config)** and **TargetDown(machine-config-controller)**.\n` +
      `• **Historical pattern:** **No recurring failed upgrade** pattern in ClusterVersion history; all recorded attempts completed.\n` +
      `• **Last success:** **${CLUSTER_CURRENT_VERSION}** completed successfully at **2026-08-18T23:12:36Z**.\n` +
      `• **Update service:** Custom upstream is working; \`RetrievedUpdates=True\`.\n` +
      `• **Node issues:** No NotReady node was confirmed in retrieved data; MCP readiness suggests **6/6 nodes updated/ready**.\n` +
      `• **Infrastructure problems:** No broad infrastructure outage was proven; issue is localized to upgrade gating and machine-config reconciliation.\n` +
      `• **MCP Issues:** **0** degraded MachineConfigPools; master and worker pools both show Updated=True, Updating=False, Degraded=False.\n` +
      `• **Escalation:** Contact Red Hat support if restoring \`${CLUSTER_BLOCKER_SECRET}\` does not clear \`Upgradeable=False\` or if machine-config remains degraded with the same payload/OSImageStream errors.\n` +
      `• **Recovery time:** Likely **short** once credentials and payload access issues are corrected; longer if the release payload metadata is inconsistent.\n` +
      `• **Next steps:** Restore/verify \`${CLUSTER_BLOCKER_SECRET}\`, then recheck ClusterVersion \`Upgradeable\` and machine-config \`Degraded\`; if machine-config still logs payload auth or missing \`rhel-10\` stream errors, gather must-gather data and escalate`,

The other control plane nodes keep running 💪\n• Worker nodes update next (workloads get rescheduled automatically)\n• Pods might restart, but most apps handle this gracefully\n\n**Pro tips:**\n• Schedule during low-traffic hours\n• Your workloads should be resilient (multiple replicas!)\n• The update can be paused if issues arise\n• You can watch real-time progress in the console!\n\n**For your current cluster:** Based on the pre-check, I estimate **2 hours 12 minutes** for the update to 4.22.0.

I'll be real with you! 💯\n\n**😌 The good news:**\n• OpenShift updates are REALLY well-tested\n• The process is automated and battle-hardened\n• Thousands of clusters update successfully every day\n• We run pre-checks to catch issues before they happen\n• Updates can be paused or rolled back if needed\n\n**🤔 The potential risks:**\n\n**1️⃣ Application compatibility:**\n• Your apps might use deprecated APIs\n• **Mitigation:** Pre-checks warn you! We scan for this\n• **Impact:** Apps might break or need updates\n• **Likelihood:** LOW if pre-check passes ✅\n\n**2️⃣ Operator incompatibility:**\n• Some operators might not support the new version\n• **Mitigation:** Update operators first!\n• **Impact:** Operator-managed workloads could have issues\n• **Likelihood:** MEDIUM if operators are outdated ⚠️\n\n**3️⃣ Custom configurations:**\n• If you've heavily customized the cluster, edge cases can occur\n• **Mitigation:** Test in a dev/staging cluster first\n• **Impact:** Varies widely\n• **Likelihood:** LOW for standard configs ✅\n\n**4️⃣ Network disruption:**\n• Brief network blips during node updates\n• **Mitigation:** Use multiple replicas and PodDisruptionBudgets\n• **Impact:** Temporary connection issues (seconds, not minutes)\n• **Likelihood:** MEDIUM but short-lived ⚠️\n\n**5️⃣ Storage issues:**\n• Persistent volume problems (rare but possible)\n• **Mitigation:** Ensure storage backend is healthy\n• **Impact:** Could affect stateful apps\n• **Likelihood:** LOW if storage is healthy ✅\n\n**6️⃣ The dreaded "stuck update":**\n• Update hangs on a node or component\n• **Mitigation:** Monitoring! We watch it closely\n• **Impact:** Delays completion, requires intervention\n• **Likelihood:** LOW (~2-3% of updates) ⚠️\n\n**🛡️ How we protect you:**\n• Pre-checks catch 80% of potential issues\n• Control plane nodes update one at a time (high availability maintained)\n• Worker nodes drain gracefully (workloads move first)\n• Updates can be paused mid-flight\n• Rollback is possible (though rarely needed)\n\n**📊 Real talk - success rate:**\n• ~97% of updates complete without any issues\n• ~2% have minor hiccups (easily resolved)\n• ~1% need intervention (but cluster stays up!)\n\n**My recommendation:** Run the pre-check (which we did!), update your operators first, schedule during low-traffic, and you'll be golden! 🌟\n\nWant to see the pre-check results for YOUR cluster?
